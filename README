Thanks To :-
E:V:A, SLS, JCSullins(Rootz Wiki), Adam Outler, many more, sorry if i've missed you out. 

Warning, Although i've tested this tool many times on my own devices, it always has the potential to damage both computer & cell phone device, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!
Changelog :
	Improved error checking 
	automated qdload detection 
	automated qdload hex & .mbn upload
	automated detection of device in sd-card mode 
	user input 
	colours
	major code changes to start support for automatic parition information & collection allowing backup to be one command and upload to a website for distribution & recovery for all
	development documentation
	Code changes to allow expansion to other Qualcomm devices
	
WINDOWS Users, Please see readme-win.txt
	 
This tool is designed to repair SHV-E160L Korean Galaxy Note 1 based on the MSM8660 & MDM9600 Qualcomm Chips
It Only works with devices that are stuck in QDLOAD mode or 05c6:9008 as the PID/VID
It uses Tool/info Written By Others as well as myself.


Namely :-

qdload - http://github.com/jcsullins/qdloader
getpartbin.py - http://blog.csdn.net/su_ky/article/details/7773273
hex2bin - hex2bin.sourceforge.net


Instructions
############


connect Qualcomm based device to usb port on linux PC, not tested under windows via USB redirection, 
on command line run  
sudo ./brickfix

Follow on screen instructions, tool will detect device in QDLOAD mode (05c6:9008) and switch to DMSS protocol, upload a hex (converted to bin for this purpose)
the hex is then executed and the device switches to Streaming Protocol, at this point we write a .mbn file to the internal emmc chip, at the end of the emmc write process the device then reboots
after the reboot re-running brixfix with detect the device in the second stage for repair , the device's emmc is accssable as a sd-card, we then write back the damaged parts of the bootchain,
at a minimum you must write a new partition table or the device will always boot in sd-card mode, WARNING, failure to write the rest of the boot chain could leave your device in a situation
which give only black-screen, no usb enumeration, dead. The only way around that is jtag, or finding the Boot resistor which switches the device back to QDLOAD mode, or emergency boot.

Come give me thanks on XDA if this tool helped you 

Additional Tools (DEV Level) 
===========================
getpartbin.py - A tool for backing up the primary partition & extended parition tables and combines them into a writable parition0.bin file (python)
qdload.pl - A tool for talking in the HDLC framed DMSS & Streaming Protocol's used by Qualcomm (Perl)
switchmode.sh - A executes qdload.pl for msm8660 device upload
get-part.sh - **DEV** unfinished tool by darkspr1te for creating partition tables in sfdisk format and .csv format (to be used in the future to create parition0.bin plus more automated collection)
tools/ - Folder containing armv5 (arm7 compatible) tools for parition manipulation and data collection
SHV-E160L-16GB/ - Folder contain SHV-E160L bootloaders & pit file
ADB/ - Folder containing adb programs
extras/ - Folder containing odin and clock work mode recovery installers for 160l devices 
QUALCOMM/ - Windows drivers (For QPST, Not required in linux, included for backwards compatability with older guides)
hex2bin - convert your xxxxMPRG.hex file to bin for use with qdload
